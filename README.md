⛏️ Full Kotlin support for [Kyori Adventure](https://github.com/KyoriPowered/adventure).

## 🤔 purpose

Since Kotlin brought us the ability to create [Extensions](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/extensions.html), we can create DSLs.

This project aimed to create many DSL utlities for adventure's builder pattern API, which make your life easier.
